## Project

Create a website where owners can list their houses and apartments for tourists to rent. To create this application, students should:
* Create a sqlite database where data about users and rentals is stored.
* Create documents using HTML and CSS that represent the web pages of the application.
* Use PHP to generate those web pages after retrieving/changing data from the database.
* Use Javascript to enhance the user experience (for example using Ajax).
